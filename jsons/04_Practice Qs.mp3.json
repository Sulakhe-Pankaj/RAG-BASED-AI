    "text": " Now we are going to solve our practice question number 7. The question says, recreate the following table using HTML. That is, I have to recreate the table given to me. Let's see what data is given to the table. I can see the title and caption of the table. A test table with merged cells. I have to write some text like this. I can see a lot of things here. I can see that this is going to be my header. I can see that the font type is not bold. So I can assume that there is nothing in the header. All the details can be written in the TD cells. That is, all the details can be written in the data cells. I don't need to use the TH cell because the heading is usually bold. And I can't see anything bold in this table. So let's understand how many rows and columns I will need. If I count the total number of rows, this will become my first row. This will become my second row. This will become my third row. And this will become my fourth row. So how many TR tags do I need? I need to use four TR tags. The last two TR tags are straightforward. I have to create four cells in this TR tag. I have to create these four cells in this TR tag. Let's focus on the easy part. First, I will create a table and give a caption. And for the last two rows, I will recreate the data. So we will delete the old table from our file. I will create a table. I will give a caption in the table. And test table with merged cells. So I have given a caption like this. After that, I know that I have to create four rows. So to create four rows, we will use four TR tags. There will be no header in this. I can write all this data in the T body. But for now, we are skipping the semantics. Because I have to focus on displaying and recreating the table. Let's complete the last three rows. I know that I have four cells in it. Which four cells are there? There is one cell, one cell, one cell, and one cell. I am going to create these four cells. First, let's make a TD tag. We will write males here. Similarly, I will get a tag again. I will write 1.9 here. Again, I will write 0.003 here. And again, TD. Here we are going to write 40%. I have to recreate the same four things in the last row. Here I am going to write females. Instead of 1.9, it will be 1.7. This will be 0.002. And this will be 43%. Let's save it. And refresh. I have recreated a table like this. It doesn't look like a table anymore. So I will write a small thing here. Border is equal to black. So I will create a border. I have completely recreated the last two rows. Now I have to focus on the upper part. Because I know that I have used attributes like colspan and rosepin. Because one cell is spreading to multiple rows and columns. Now let's talk about these two rows. This is my first row. This is my row 1. And this is my second row. This is my row 2. Now if I talk about the first row, what data is coming in the first row? One is my cell which is completely empty. The cell is not there. The space is full. But nothing is written in it. So what I will do is I will create an element with the header tag TD. But I will leave it completely empty. After that, I have another cell in the first row. The item written in it is average. And the third is red eyes. So if I have to create the first row in a way, then I will write TR first. And like this. There are three items in the first row. One is my TD which is completely empty. The second is my TD in which I am going to write average. The third is my data item in which I am going to write red eyes. I have created this, I have created this, I have created this. Now let's see their size. By default, everyone gets one row and one column. Let's talk about this empty cell. How many rows has it occupied? Two horizontal lines are going from it, covering the entire table. So it has occupied two rows. And how many columns has it occupied? Only one column. So it has occupied two columns. I need only one column to cover the table. So it has occupied one column. If I talk about its average. So it has occupied a single row. But if I talk about columns, it has occupied two columns. So here is one row and two columns. If I talk about red eyes. So it has occupied two rows and one single column. So let's write two rows and a single column here. Now I know that everyone gets one by default. So let's remove one column from here, one row from here, and one column from here. I know what I have to do to occupy two rows. It will have to give an attribute. Row span equals two. Here to occupy two columns, I have to give an attribute to the tree. Call span equals two. And I have to give an attribute to it too. Row span equals two. So what am I going to do? I am going to write all three. So in my row, first of all. I will create a data cell. First of all, giving the attribute of row span equals two to the data cell. I will keep it empty. After that, I am going to create a second cell. The value will come in it. I will have the value of average and call span in it. Two equals. I will create a third cell. I will give it red eyes. And the value of row span in it will be equal to two. For now, let's save and refresh it. I have created a single row. But for now, the row span and column span have not been implemented. It has not been implemented because it cannot be logically implemented. Because to span up to two rows, I should have some items in the next row. Now let's talk about the second row. If I look inside the second row, I have four items. Out of the four items, this empty cell and this red eye cell. We have already created this in the first row. I have to create two items. Height and weight. It is taking only one row and one column. The weight cell occupies one row and one column. Now we are going to create the second row. First of all, we will create a data cell in the second row. In which the height will come. And the weight will be written in the cell other than that. Let's save it and refresh it. Now my table looks exactly the same as we started creating it. Earlier, the empty cell, the average and the red eye cell were coming in a single line. But as soon as I created the second row, It has adjusted two rows and occupied the entire area. The first row items that I had defined in the form of attributes. So this is how we use tables in HTML. We have already learned all the important things in tables. As a beginner or while learning web development. We have already learned them. So this is the part of tables in HTML. After this, the only homework for you is to complete the assignment problems related to tables. By giving us time, we will be able to solve the small problems in the beginning. Gradually we will be increasing the level. And the next topic we will be studying is forms in HTML."
