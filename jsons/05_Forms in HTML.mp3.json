    "text": " In the next part, we will talk about an important concept of HTML, i.e. forms. The work of forms is to collect data in real life and HTML. We have seen many such forms on different websites. I am showing you an example of Instagram. Where I am given some options to type something, there is a place to type this password, then I have a button with which I submit all the information to Instagram. In the same way, when we create an account on Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp, we have to type our number first, then we get the OTP, and then we get the account. So whenever we go to a website or app as a new user, or whenever we log in, register, sign up, try to contact, then we see different forms on different websites. One or two examples of this can be like this. If I search on the internet, log in to Instagram. So in this way, after clicking on the first link, I will have a form display. Here I can fill my phone number, username, email address, I will have a password here, I will have a username here. Now there are different things in the forms that we notice. When we type the username, it is visible, but whenever we type the password, it is visible in the form of dot. So that no one can see our password when we type it. So in this way, there are many things in the form, which are small things in detail that matter. This login is a button in itself, after clicking it, an action is performed. Now the action was performed, he checked the phone number, password is wrong, so we saw an error message. If I click on sign up, then for sign up, Instagram will give me a separate form, in which there will be an option for mobile number, there will be an option for full name, username, password. So in this way, this is a separate button for sign up. Login with Facebook is a button in its app, if you click on it, then Facebook has its own separate form, which will open. So we see such forms on many different websites, and all these forms, we can recreate with the help of HTML forms. First of all, we are going to talk about its syntax in the forms. Like we use the table tag to make tables, in the same way, to make forms in HTML, we are using this form tag. All the content of the form, that I have to take text, I have to take the input of the number, I have to make a button, all the things come under this form tag. So if I write a form in my HTML, then I will have a form created, but because that form will be empty now, nothing will be displayed on my screen. Like I have made a classroom.html file, in this, in the body tag, I am going to make a form tag. Let's save this, and if I open and refresh this file, then now my whole page is empty, because I have made a form, but now there is no content in this form. So slowly we will read about different contents, elements, and attributes of the form. The first thing about which we are going to read in the forms is my action attribute. What is the function of the action attribute? In the form tag, I can define my action attribute. And its function is that it tells what action should be performed after submitting the form. The function of the form is to take a lot of data input from the user, but what to do with this data? Once all the data is submitted, then where should I send this data? This is what my action attribute tells me. So action gives me an address that all the data of the form should be sent to this address. Or send it to this address. If we look at its definition, then action attribute is used to define what action needs to be performed when a form is submitted. For example, if we submit a form, then we click the login button. If we submit a form, then we click the register button. When we submit the final form, then where should we send all the data? Or what action should be performed? This is what my action attribute tells me. Usually, where does this action attribute get redirected? Either to a JavaScript file or to another file that will perform some work with that data. For example, here I have written action.php file. So an example is that I have created a PHP file named action.php which will perform some action with the data of this form. Or I can redirect it to any sub-URL. For example, if I write slash action, then my browser will search the file slash action and try to send all the data there. For now, we can write anything in action, but later on, how actions are performed with this data, where it is sent, how it works in the file, we will understand all these things in detail while reading JavaScript. For now, I will create an action attribute in my form stack. I will write it as slash server. Or instead of slash server, for now, we will write it as slash action. Let's save this. But my form will not be created yet. My entire web page will be empty because there is no content in the form. When we talk about content in the form, we usually talk about buttons or input text. So, the first thing we will read in terms of form element is my input element."
