    "text": " Next, we will talk about name attribute in forms. Whenever I submit information from my form, it is always in the name-value pair. For example, if I enter a username in any input, then I have to send a name-value pair for the information of that username. In which the value will be the text that I have entered in the username input box, and the name will be the attribute that I am defining. So, I always have to define attributes with my input. So that in the backend or wherever my data has been sent, I can find out what information has been entered in the input box. So, whatever I enter in the input box, to access it, to refer it, the name we use, we define it in the name attribute. Let's see a small example of this. I am going to remove all this information in the form and only keep my username and password. So, let's refresh this form once. Let's remove this hello button from here. I have two things, username and my password. Now, in the username, as soon as I submit some information, let's assume I wrote abcd here, and in the password also wrote abcd. Now, let's add one more extra thing here, which is my submit button. Let's refresh it again. abcd, abcd and submit. What happens after submitting? My file is processed and I am redirected to this link. But here, as soon as I give a name to the username, I mean, I will give a name to this input type. Let's assume we keep its name equal to username. Here, this thing will seem confusing to you that the ID is also username, I could have written username in the placeholder only, but I am not confused with it. Basically, a good similarity is being made, that's why I have written username in the name. Now, I am going to save this and refresh it. Again, I will enter abcd in the username, and in the password, I will enter abcd. And now I am going to submit. Now, the URL seems a little different. Let me copy and paste it here. Now, what is visible in the URL? The part up to the server is fine, because it is the same thing that I put in the action of my form. But after that, I can see username equals abcd. So, this username is basically a name. This is the name that I have given to my input, and after that, its value has come. What value did I put in it? The value that I put in the form, that was equal to abcd. So, all the information that I send in the form, is sent in the form of name equals value. Where the name is the name of my name attribute in the input element, and the value is the value that I actually add in the input element. If I had written a query instead of a username, let's remove it, let's save it, now I have written the name as a query. Now, if I refresh it, and I am going to write abcd here again, I entered my password and submitted it. So, here it is written that query equals abcd. Query means the name that I gave to my input element, and abcd means the value that I entered in the input element. So, in this way, we give a name attribute to the value that we want to refer, after the submission of a form. By default, in general, the name attribute in the form is not compulsory, but whenever we make our form and make input elements in it, we will always define a name attribute in it. Because we want the information that we are sending in the form of the data of the form, to be accessible in the backend, and to access it, we use the name attribute. Similarly, I give the name again, username, and here in the input, I define another name attribute, we give it the name password. Usually, the name we keep is a little small, so here, instead of username, we keep only user, and instead of password, we keep only pass. So, the value of our name attribute is generally a little small. Now, I write the password here, and I submit it, so I can see above that the user is equal to abcd, and the pass is equal to abcd. That is, the value that I entered in the username, and the value that I entered in the password, now passes with my URL. That is, the information is being passed here. Now, this is a very unsafe way to pass information, because as soon as I submit a form, so it is not necessary that the URL goes only to the backend server, there are many different entities in between, to whom the URL goes, so in the URL, generally, we do not pass sensitive information. So, here my password is very sensitive information, which is visible in my URL, which should not be visible. If you log in on Instagram, if you log in on Facebook, or log in on any other website, there we do not see the passwords in the URL, but here we see. So, this is a very unsafe way. So, when we read about HTTP protocols in JavaScript, about GET request, about POST request, then we will know how to remove this information from our URL. Now, all the data is being passed in the form of GET request, but when we start using POST request, then we will be able to remove this password from our URL, and the rest of the sensitive information from the URL. But for now, we have to ignore that thing. For now, just pay attention to this thing, that as soon as I defined the name, the name is equal to value. We can see the same thing in Google search. If I go to google.com, and let's say I searched for Apple, as soon as I searched for Apple, if I observe the URL, then here comes google.com, search question mark, but after that comes Q is equal to Apple. I just have to see this part, not the next part. Q is equal to Apple. And if I search for Mango instead of Apple, then here comes Q is equal to Mango. If I search for watch instead of this, then here comes Q is equal to watch. So here too, this is a pair of name is equal to value, which is being made on Google. We can observe the same thing on YouTube. If I search for Apple on YouTube, then here comes search query is equal to Apple. If I search for Microsoft, then here comes search query is equal to Microsoft. So in this input box, the information we are typing on YouTube, is also being typed in the input box. For this input box, the name that YouTube has defined, that is equal to search query. And for this input box, the name that Google has defined, that is equal to Q. Now if I want, then I can directly search things on YouTube. That means whatever search is done on YouTube, like if I search for Google instead of Microsoft, then what happens? The rest of the URL remains the same. Only the change happens. This search query is equal to something. So what can I do? If I copy this YouTube URL, and make it in my form URL, or in fact, if I create a separate form, let's assume I created this separate form, and what am I going to do in the action of this form? In the action, I will copy the entire URL of YouTube. And here I will give an input box, whose type I will write text. And in this, I will make a placeholder. Search in YouTube. And I will give it a name, which is equal to this search query. I have given it a name equal to search query. Search underscore query. And lastly, I have given a button which is equal to search query. And lastly, I have given a button which is equal to submit button. Or I can call it search button. Now here in the action, I am going to keep the results in the URL. Because question mark and search query are equal. All these things automatically add to the URL as soon as my form is submitted. So I will remove this information. I will save it. And now I will refresh my page. So this is my separate form. In fact, I will give a horizontal line here. In the form of HR. So this is my second form. In the second form, I have an input box, in which I can type any text. And I have a search button. Now here I am going to type Apple. As soon as I type Apple and click on search, what happened? Whatever I searched, it was converted into YouTube search. Because YouTube, from where I get the results, I sent a request to the same URL in my HTML form. So now I understood what action actually does. Action sends the data of my input box to this URL. As soon as action sends the data of my input box to this URL, similarly, a question mark will be placed here. Then my name will come. Search query's name will come. By typing search query is equal to something, a proper actual URL of YouTube will be created. With the help of this, whatever I am typing in the input of a simple web page, it will go to YouTube on YouTube servers. And there will be a search in YouTube. And I will start seeing a YouTube page. But if here instead of search query, I just write search queue, by saving it, if I refresh again, and now if I type Apple here, then I will see that no results are found. No results are found because there is nothing like search queue in YouTube. URL of YouTube is fixed. What comes in the URL of YouTube? Search query will always be searched. So that's why it didn't understand what is search queue. So if I want to connect my web page with a normal existing big website, then simply I have to see its URL. In that, I have to see that for which information I am searching, what is the name of my input element in the value that is being passed. By seeing these simple basic things, I can connect my two different pages."
