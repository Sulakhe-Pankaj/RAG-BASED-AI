    "text": " Next element is my text area element. I can create a text area in my form. Basically, it's job is to take input of text. Usually, if you want to take feedback or comments in any form, or if I want to write a paragraph or a big passage, then I use a text area element for that. To create a text area element, we use a text area tag. We can give an ID to it and attach it to the tag to create a label. Let's create a text area for that. Let's give a line gap here. I'm going to create a text area. Let's click on save and refresh. This space for text is called a text area. There are many lines and text here. We can add more text here. I can also add a label in this text area. Let's say I added a label here. Let's give an ID to the text area. Let's take an example that I want to take feedback from a user. So, label for feedback. Please give your valuable feedback. We can write a line like this. Let's click on save and refresh. Please give your valuable feedback. It was a great experience. We can type something like this and submit it. It's not going inside the URL because I haven't given a name attribute yet. As soon as I give a name attribute to the text area, which is my feedback, let's save it and refresh. It was good. Now I will submit it. All the text will be in the feedback. It's not important which format it goes in. It was good. It has perceived the exclamation in the form. All the things I wrote in the text area are being submitted in the form. The size of the text area is 2 rows and 10 columns. We can change it with the help of row and column attribute. Let's say I want a text area of 5 rows. I will write rows is equal to 5. Let's save and refresh. The text area is big. Similarly, if I want a lot of columns, I will write columns equals 100. Let's refresh. It's bigger and longer. If I want a bigger size, I have to use the attribute of rows and columns. We are not going to resize it for now. We will keep it this much. I can also add a placeholder. I can write placeholder. Write your feedback here. Let's save and refresh. Write your feedback here. This is my feedback. Placeholder will also come. All the information will be submitted in the form."
