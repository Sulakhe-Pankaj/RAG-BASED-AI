Based on the given chunks, I can provide an answer to your question about placeholders.

According to chunk 07 (Labels) with number 07, a placeholder is defined as "So, placeholder means a text that is visible before adding the actual value."

Chunk 07 (Labels) also mentions, "we call it a placeholder." and "Placeholder means that you have kept someone to stop the place." 

These chunks suggest that placeholders are used to provide a visible hint or text before entering any actual value.

Please note that chunk 15 (Text Area) briefly mentions "I can write placeholder.", but doesn't provide more information about what a placeholder is.
